# Settings Files Mapper

 MO2 Plugin that maps files to the My Games folder. Useful for mods that store their settings files in there.

## Installation

 1. Extract the plugin python script to the plugins folder in your MO2 install.
 2. Create an empty mod folder called "SettingsFilesMapper".
 3. Place any files you want to be mapped to the \Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\ folder into the mod.
